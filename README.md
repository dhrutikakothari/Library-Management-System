# Library Management System (LMS)

## Overview
The Library Management System (LMS) is a Java-based application designed to streamline the management of books within a library. This user-friendly system allows librarians or administrators to perform various tasks related to book management. The application follows a fundamental MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, dividing responsibilities among the model, view, and controller components.

## Model
- Represents the application's data and business logic.
- Manages data, logic, and rules of the application.
- Encapsulates the state and behavior of the application.
- Independent of the user interface; no direct interaction with the presentation layer.

## View
- Represents the user interface and presentation layer.
- Displays data to the user and captures user input.
- Receives user input and sends commands to the controller.
- Responsible for presenting data and receiving user interactions, with minimal knowledge of the underlying application logic.

## Controller
- Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.
- Handles user input and updates the model accordingly.
- Orchestrates the flow of data between the model and the view.
- Contains the application's business logic, governing how data is processed and presented.
